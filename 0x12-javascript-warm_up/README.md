# JavaScript

This readme file gives a brief descriptions of the JavasScript concepts covered in this repository through various projects.

## Why JavaScript programming is amazing

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development. It's the language of the web, enabling interactive and dynamic websites. Plus, with Node.js, you can use JavaScript for server-side scripting as well.

## How to run a JavaScript script

JavaScript scripts can be run in a web browser or on a server with Node.js. In a browser, you would include your script in an HTML file using the `<script>` tag. With Node.js, you can run your script from the command line with `node yourfile.js`.

## How to create variables and constants

In JavaScript, you can create variables using the `let` keyword and constants using the `const` keyword. For example, `let myVariable = 5;` or `const myConstant = 10;`.

## Differences between var, const and let

`var` is function scoped and can be redeclared. `let` and `const` are block scoped. `let` can be reassigned, but `const` cannot.

## Data types in JavaScript

JavaScript has several data types including `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Object`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Symbol` and `BigInt`.

## Using if, if ... else statements

`if` statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. `if ... else` statements can be used to select one of two blocks to be executed.

## How to use comments

In JavaScript, you can create a single-line comment using `//` and a multi-line comment using `/* */`.

## Affecting values to variables

You can assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator. For example, `let myVariable = 5;`.

## Using while and for loops

`while` and `for` loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. `while` loops continue until a specified condition evaluates to false. `for` loops run a specified number of times.

## Using break and continue statements

`break` is used to exit a loop early, while `continue` skips the current iteration and moves on to the next one.

## What is a function and how to use functions

A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. A function is executed when it's called (or invoked). Functions are defined using the `function` keyword.

## What does a function that does not use any return statement return

A function without a return statement returns `undefined`.

## Scope of variables

In JavaScript, the scope of a variable refers to the region of code where a variable can be accessed. Variables can have global scope (accessible anywhere), function scope (accessible within the function they were declared), or block scope (accessible within the block they were declared).

## Arithmetic operators in JavaScript

JavaScript has several arithmetic operators including `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulus), `++` (increment), and `--` (decrement).

## How to manipulate dictionary

In JavaScript, objects can be used as dictionaries. You can manipulate them by adding, modifying, or deleting properties.

## How to import a file

You can import JavaScript modules using the `import` statement. For example, `import { myFunction } from './myModule.js';`.
