**Unit Testing and its Implementation in Large Projects**
Unit testing is the first step of testing in the software development life cycle. It involves validating each testable part (also known as units/modules/components) of a software application to determine if each unit of the applicationâ€™s code works as intended[^1^]. Unit testing is usually performed in the early development stages of an application by developers and QA engineers[^1^]. For large projects, start by working testing into your bugfix process - every fixed bug gets a test[^2^].

**Serialization and Deserialization of a Class**
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory[^3^]. This mechanism is used to persist the object[^3^].

**Writing and Reading a JSON File**
In Python, you can use the `json` package to read and write JSON files[^4^]. The ```json.dump()``` or ```json.dumps()``` functions can be used to convert Python objects into their respective JSON object[^4^].

**Usage of *args in Python**
The special syntax ```*args``` in function definitions in Python is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function[^5^]. It is used to pass a non-keyworded, variable-length argument list[^5^].

**Usage of **kwargs in Python**
The special syntax ```**kwargs``` in function definitions in Python is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list[^5^]. We use the name kwargs with the double star[^6^].

**Handling Named Arguments in a Function**
In Python, you can pass a dictionary of keywords arguments to a function using the ```**``` operator[^7^]. The keys of the dictionary are the parameter names in the function[^7^].
