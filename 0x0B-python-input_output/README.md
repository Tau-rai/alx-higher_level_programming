**This repository focuses about the Python I/O**

**Opening a File**
To open a file in Python, use the built-in ```open()``` function. The ```open()``` function takes two parameters: filename, and mode.

**Writing to a File**
To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the ```open()``` function: ```"a"``` - Append - will append to the end of the file, ```"w"``` - Write - will overwrite any existing content.

**Reading a File**
To read a file in Python, we must open the file in reading mode.

**Moving the Cursor in a File**
The ```seek()``` method moves the cursor to a new file position. The new position is specified as the number of bytes from the beginning of the file.

**Closing a File**
After finishing working with a file, it should be closed using the ```close()``` method.

**The ```with``` Statement**
The ```with``` statement in Python is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams.

**JSON**
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data format with diverse uses in data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.

**Serialization**
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later.

**Deserialization**
Deserialization is the reverse of serialization, it is the process of converting the serialized format back into a usable data structure.

**Python to JSON**
Python has a built-in package called ```json```, which can be used to work with JSON data. If you have a JSON string, you can parse it by using the ```json.loads()``` method.
